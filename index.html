        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns"><p>I, Loretta Guzman, am the owner of the Bison Coffeehouse, I am a Portland Native and a Tribal member of the Shoshone Bannock tribes of Fort Hall Idaho. In 2008 I was diagnosed with stage 4B cancer and when denied health insurance in Oregon, I returned to Fort Hall, Idaho and with the help of my immediate family and the Shoshone Bannock Tribes, underwent an aggressive treatments of chemotherapy that followed with radiation. While I could feel myself dying as cancer tried to consume my life, I had a dream of this huge Bison that was drawing near me and I drew near him to the point that we were face to face and just stared at each other. I told my stepfather Paul "G.I" Fasthorse of this dream, and he told me I would get better that he had been praying to my grandparents from the after life to heal me. My Bannock Grandfather Harrison Baker, was very tall and big man. He often danced wearing a Buffalo cap. After this dream, I eventually went into remission with the help of my Grandparents from the after life, my family and the help of my Tribe in 2009 after which time I returned to Portland, Oregon. <br><br>
          I returned and continued to work for Kibby Riedman as the manager of his café. I also returned to school, but I told Kibby I wanted to go into business for myself and open my own coffeehouse. He introduced me to Heart Coffee and guided me along the way and since has become my mentor. When I told him of my dream as we were deciding on a business name, he told me Bison Coffeehouse would be the name for my shop.<br><br>
          I worked on my dream for 2 years wanting it to reflect who I am and my Native heritage in a positive way. I had a lot of help from family pushing me along the way to get to opening my doors and placing each piece of artwork in its place. Each piece of artwork represents many Native artists from across the United States and also gives the local and visiting Natives a place they can identify with in positive ways. I also wanted to help revive this beautiful 1926 building in the Cully Neighborhood and bring life into it so it can thrive for this neighborhood and give the neighborhood a place of their own.
